# Ally
Ally is a project by myself that is basiacally a combination of different apps and games.
So far I have the Guessing Game, a very basic number game in which you try to guess a randomly generated number in 3 tries.
  Guessing Game 2.0 is the same principle, but with unlimited guesses thanks to a loop that I made. It was different enough from the original game that I just put it up seperately.
Element Fighter is really just an advanced version of Rock Paper Scissors, just with more options.
  In the New Element Fighter update I added better AI and more options.
